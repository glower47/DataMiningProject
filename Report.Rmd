# Exercise 6, Chapter 7.10
#### The annual population of Afghanistan is available in the global_economy data set. <br>

```
afg_people <- data.frame(Year = subset(global_economy, Code == "AFG")$Year, Population = subset(global_economy, Code == "AFG")$Population)
```
<br>

#### a) Plot the data and comment on its features. Can you observe the effect of the Soviet-Afghan war?
```
ggplot(afg_people, aes(x = Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_point()
```
During the Soviet-Afghan war, Afghanistan had a declining population.

<br>

#### b) Fit a linear trend model and compare this to a piecewise linear trend model with knots at 1980 and 1989.


```
ggplot(afg_people, aes(x = Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = 1980)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = 1989)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + # Fit a linear trend model
  geom_smooth(method = "gam") # Fit a piecewise linear trend model with knots at 1980 and 1989
```

<br>

#### c) Generate forecasts from these two models for the five years after the end of the data, and comment on the results.


```
# Fit a linear model to the data
lm_model <- lm(Population ~ Year, data = afg_people)

# Generate the forecasted values for the next 5 years
forecast <- data.frame(Year = seq(max(afg_people$Year) + 1, max(afg_people$Year) + 5))
forecast$Population <- predict(lm_model, newdata = forecast)

# Combine the original data and the forecasted values
final_forecast <- rbind(afg_people, forecast)

# Plot the forecasted values using geom_line()
ggplot(final_forecast, aes(x = Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
<br>

# Exercise 1, Chapter 8.8

#### Consider the the number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, available in the aus_livestock dataset.
<br>

#### a)Use the ETS() function to estimate the equivalent model for simple exponential smoothing. Find the optimal values of α and ℓ0, and generate forecasts for the next four months.
```
pigs <- subset(aus_livestock, Animal == "Pigs" & State == "Victoria")

mymodel <- ets(pigs$Count)
myforecast <- forecast(mymodel, level = 95, fan = TRUE, h = 4)
autoplot(myforecast)
```
