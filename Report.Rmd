# Exercise 6, Chapter 7.10
#### The annual population of Afghanistan is available in the global_economy data set. <br>

```
afg_people <- data.frame(Year = subset(global_economy, Code == "AFG")$Year, Population = subset(global_economy, Code == "AFG")$Population)
```
<br>

#### a) Plot the data and comment on its features. Can you observe the effect of the Soviet-Afghan war?
```
ggplot(afg_people, aes(x = Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_point()
```
During the Soviet-Afghan war, Afghanistan had a declining population.

<br>

#### b) Fit a linear trend model and compare this to a piecewise linear trend model with knots at 1980 and 1989.


```
ggplot(afg_people, aes(x = Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(aes(x = 1980)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = 1989)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + # Fit a linear trend model
  geom_smooth(method = "gam") # Fit a piecewise linear trend model with knots at 1980 and 1989
```

<br>

#### c) Generate forecasts from these two models for the five years after the end of the data, and comment on the results.


```
# Fit a linear model to the data
lm_model <- lm(Population ~ Year, data = afg_people)

# Generate the forecasted values for the next 5 years
forecast <- data.frame(Year = seq(max(afg_people$Year) + 1, max(afg_people$Year) + 5))
forecast$Population <- predict(lm_model, newdata = forecast)

# Combine the original data and the forecasted values
final_forecast <- rbind(afg_people, forecast)

# Plot the forecasted values using geom_line()
ggplot(final_forecast, aes(x = Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# Exercise 1, Chapter 8.8

#### Consider the the number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, available in the aus_livestock dataset.
<br>

#### a)Use the ETS() function to estimate the equivalent model for simple exponential smoothing. Find the optimal values of α and ℓ0, and generate forecasts for the next four months.
```
pigs <- subset(aus_livestock, Animal == "Pigs" & State == "Victoria")

mymodel <- ets(pigs$Count)
myforecast <- forecast(mymodel, level = 95, fan = TRUE, h = 4)
autoplot(myforecast)
```
<br>

# Exercise 2, Chapter 8.8

#### Write your own function to implement simple exponential smoothing. The function should take arguments y (the time series), alpha (the smoothing parameter α) and level (the initial level ℓ0). It should return the forecast of the next observation in the series. Does it give the same forecast as ETS()?
<br>

```
simple_exponential_smoothing <- function(y, alpha, level) {
  # Initialize empty vector to store smoothed values
  smoothed <- numeric(length(y))
  
  # Set initial value of smoothed to initial level
  smoothed[1] <- level
  
  # Loop through time series and calculate smoothed values
  for (i in 2:length(y)) {
    smoothed[i] <- alpha * y[i] + (1 - alpha) * smoothed[i-1]
  }
  
  # Return forecast of next observation in the series
  return(alpha * y[length(y)] + (1 - alpha) * smoothed[length(y)])
}

y <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
alpha <- 0.5
level <- 1

my_forecast <- simple_exponential_smoothing(y, alpha, level)
print(my_forecast)
```

<br>

# Exercise 3, Chapter 8.8

#### Modify your function from the previous exercise to return the sum of squared errors rather than the forecast of the next observation. Then use the optim() function to find the optimal values of α and ℓ0. Do you get the same values as the ETS() function?
<br>

```
simple_exponential_smoothing_modified <- function(y, alpha, level) {
  # Initialize empty vector to store smoothed values
  smoothed <- numeric(length(y))
  
  # Set initial value of smoothed to initial level
  smoothed[1] <- level
  
  # Loop through time series and calculate smoothed values
  for (i in 2:length(y)) {
    smoothed[i] <- alpha * y[i] + (1 - alpha) * smoothed[i-1]
  }
  
  # Initialize variable to store SSE
  sse <- 0
  
  # Loop through time series and calculate SSE
  for (i in 1:length(y)) {
    sse <- sse + (y[i] - smoothed[i])^2
  }
  
  # Return SSE
  return(sse)
}

y <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
alpha <- 0.5
level <- 1

my_forecast <- simple_exponential_smoothing_modified(y, alpha, level)
print(my_forecast)
```
